These paradigms display an unconditional trust in the power of Western technology and scientific knowledge to trigger development-they taste of epistemic and technological determinism. This article probes, by means of a genealogy, how and when development cooperation began adhering to epistemic and technological determinism, and which forms this adhesion has taken over time. The genealogy shows, first, that knowledge and technology have always been integrally part of the very \"development'' idea since this idea was shaped during enlightenment. Second, while the genealogy reveals that epistemic and technological determinism were embedded in the development idea from the very beginning, it also illustrates that the determinism has always been challenged by critical voices.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"        39","file":[{"content_type":"application/pdf","file_name":"Cherlet_2014_Epistemic_and_technological_determinism_in_development_aid.pdf","date_created":"2012-09-26T10:42:16Z","relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2015-11-27T15:13:50Z","file_id":"4300564","file_size":"219568","access_level":"local"}],"_id":"2999351","doi":"10.1177/0162243913516806","accept":1,"locked":1,"volume":39,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["0162-2439"]},"year":"2014","date_created":"2012-09-26T10:42:16Z","creator":{"id":"F6EC3958-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES","date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:39:52Z","status":"public","publication_status":"published","issue":"6","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"department":[{"_id":"PS05","tree":[{"_id":"PS"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"page_last":"794","classification":"A1","type":"journal_article","title":"Epistemic and technological determinism in development aid","wos_type":"Article","subject":["Law and Political Science"],"date_approved":"2012-09-28T14:22:17Z"}

Their osteogenic performance was assessed with removal torque, histomorphometry, and nanoindentation in a rabbit model after 2 and 4 weeks. The performance of the test implants was compared with turned control implants (T), alkali- and heat-treated implants (AH), and AH implants coated with laminin-1. \r\nResults: After 2 weeks, TL demonstrated significantly higher removal torque as compared with T and equivalent to AH. Bone area was significantly higher for the test surface after 4 weeks, while no significant changes were detected on the micromechanical properties of the surrounding bone. \r\nConclusions: Within the limitations of this study, our results suggest a great potential for laminin-1 as a coating agent. A turned implant surface coated with laminin-1 could enhance osseointegration comparable with a bioactive implant surface while keeping the surface smooth.","lang":"eng"}],"citation":{"apa":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Bougas, K., Jimbo, R., Vandeweghe, S., Tovar, N., Baldassarri, M., Alenezi, A., Janal, M., et al.

Hydrogels consisting of gellan gum (GG), an inexpensive calcium-crosslinkable polysaccharide, have been applied in cartilage TE. To improve GG suitability as a material for bone TE, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme involved in mineralization of bone by cleaving phosphate from organic phosphate, was incorporated into GG hydrogels to induce mineralization with calcium phosphate (CaP). Incorporated ALP induced formation of apatite-like material on the submicron scale within GG gels, as shown by FTIR, SEM, EDS, XRD, ICP-OES, TGA and von Kossa staining. Increasing ALP concentration increased amounts of CaP as well as stiffness. Mineralized GG was able to withstand sterilization by autoclaving, although stiffness decreased. In addition, mineralizability and stiffness of GG was enhanced by the incorporation of polydopamine (PDA). Furthermore, mineralization of GG led to enhanced attachment and vitality of cells in vitro while cytocompatibility of the mineralized gels was comparable to one of the most commonly used bone substitute materials. The results proved that ALP-mediated enzymatic mineralization of GG could be enhanced by functionalization with PDA.

The empirical research of these aspects, however, has been hampered by the difficulty to disentangle past and present contextual effects. In this respect, first generation migrants offer an interesting case study which allows us to discern (1) contextual effects experienced during childhood, i.e. associated with the origin country, (2) contextual effects experienced during later life, i.e. associated with the destination country and (3) individual effects experienced during later life in the destination country. We test hypotheses using the European Social Survey (ESS) in cross-classified multilevel analyses on 5,900 individuals within on the one hand 25 destination countries and on the other 146 origin countries. While insecurity theory offers interesting prospects of explaining origin country variance, the applicability of insecurity theory to migrants at the individual and destination level is questioned by the results.","lang":"eng"}],"page_first":"998","citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Van der Bracht K, Van de Putte B, Van de Velde S.

Only a very limited number of studies have focused on the implementation of lean manufacturing practices within Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) operating in the food sector. The majority of these studies used the case study method and concentrated on individual lean manufacturing techniques geared towards resolving efficiency issues. The objective of this empirical study is to analyze the status of the lean manufacturing practices and their benefits and barriers among European food processing SMEs. \r\nMethodology: A structured questionnaire was developed to collect data. A total of 35 SMEs’ representatives, mostly CEOs and operations managers, participated in the survey. The study investigated the role of two control variables in lean implementation: size of the company and country of origin. \r\nFinding: The findings show that lean manufacturing practice deployment in food processing SMEs is generally low and still evolving. However, some lean manufacturing practices are more prevalent than others: e.g. flow, pull and statistical process control are not widely used by the food processing SMEs whereas total productive maintenance, employee involvement and customer association are more widespread. The key barriers encountered by food SMEs in the implementation of lean manufacturing practices result from the special characteristics of the food sector such as highly perishable products, complicated processing, extremely variable raw materials, recipes, unpredictable demand, etc. Moreover, a lack of knowledge and resources makes it difficult for food processing SMEs to embark on the lean journey. \r\nOriginality: The gap in the literature regarding the application of lean manufacturing in food sector is identified and addressed in this study. The originality of this paper lies in analyzing the current status of the use of lean manufacturing practices among food SMEs in Europe and identifying potential barriers.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"       116","issue":"1","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"page_last":"141","department":[{"_id":"LA01","tree":[{"_id":"LA"},{"_id":"UGent"}]},{"_id":"TW18","tree":[{"_id":"TW"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","title":"Application of lean practices in small and medium sized food enterprises","type":"journal_article","subject":["Business and Economics"],"date_approved":"2013-01-24T16:25:23Z","creator":{"id":"26D118F0-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL","publication_abbreviation":"Br.

Recently, questions have been raised whether the disease management approach is appropriate to respond to patient-defined needs. \r\nObjective: In this article we consider the responsiveness of current European DMPs to patients' needs defined in terms of multimorbidity, functional and participation problems, and self-management. \r\nMethod: Information about existing DMPs was derived from a survey among country-experts. In addition, we made use of international scientific literature. \r\nResults: Most European DMPs do not have a solid answer yet to the problem of multimorbidity. Methods of linking DMPs, building extra modules to deal with the most prevalent comorbidities and integration of case management principles are introduced. Rehabilitation, psychosocial and reintegration support are not included in all DMPs, and the involvement of the social environment of the patient is uncommon. Interventions tailored to the needs of specific social or cultural patient groups are mostly not available. Few DMPs provide access to individualized patient information to strengthen self-management, including active engagement in decision making. \r\nConclusion: To further improve the responsiveness of DMPs to patients' needs, we suggest to monitor' patient relevant outcomes' that might be based on the ICF-model. To address the needs of patients with multimorbidity, we propose a generic comprehensive model, embedded in primary care. Agoal-oriented approach provides the opportunity to prioritize goals that really matter to patients."}],"keyword":["disease management","goal-oriented care","multi morbidity","self-management","patients' needs","chronic illness"],"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Rijken M, Bekkema N, Boeckxstaens P, Schellevis FG, De Maeseneer J, Groenewegen P.

This exhumation campaign is often interpreted in psychopathological terms as a natural reaction to a traumatic past and as proving that this past should be healed by a therapeutic memory that fosters closure -- a  vision that we call 'trauma-therapy-closure (TTC) time'. Although this vision is in line with widespread 'transitional justice' discourse it should be critically analyzed. We argue that the Spanish situation does not prove the naturalness and universal applicability of TTC time. Although we do identify an influential exhumation group that shares aspects of this TTC vision, its approach is contested by local actors and competing exhumation organizations that engage in alternative politics of time. Therefore we demonstrate how the case of Spain rather reveals how TTC time is actively disseminated and promoted on a local level.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"         7"}

Apart from aspects like site function and occupation intensity, methodological aspects play a considerable role. In the Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands, neolithisation is documented at the Final Mesolithic sites Hardinxveld-Giessendam Polderweg and Hardinxveld-Giessendam De Bruin and the local Early Neolithic sites of Brandwijk-Kerkhof and the Hazendonk, covering the period of 5500–2500 cal. B.C. The off-site core from Hardinxveld-Giessendam De Bruin supports earlier results that human influence on the vegetation at Hardinxveld is restricted and difficult to distinguish from natural vegetation disturbance. Human impact is more easily recognisable in the diagrams of Neolithic phases at Brandwijk-Kerkhof and the Hazendonk that show evidence of both domestic animals and cereals. Continuing Neolithisation and also research methodology, including the location of the pollen cores, may play a role in this. It is tested whether the use of a new pollen sum excluding extra-regional taxa increases the visibility of human impact.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","_id":"3212191","file":[{"date_updated":"2014-02-25T12:35:24Z","relation":"main_file","file_name":"10.1007_s00334-013-0396-0.pdf","date_created":"2013-05-14T09:49:43Z","content_type":"application/pdf","file_size":"737654","access_level":"closed","file_id":"3212245"},{"date_updated":"2014-02-25T12:35:24Z","relation":"main_file","file_name":"art_Out_2014.pdf","date_created":"2013-05-14T09:49:43Z","content_type":"application/pdf","file_size":"734759","access_level":"local","file_id":"4303502"}],"locked":1,"accept":1,"doi":"10.1007/s00334-013-0396-0","date_created":"2013-05-14T09:49:43Z","year":"2014","publication_identifier":{"issn":["0939-6314"]},"volume":23}

Diagnosis can usually be made with radiography and ultrasonography; however, in some cases, these techniques are inconclusive and additional imaging is necessary. No studies describing computed tomography (CT) features of different tarsal lesions in horses with tarsal lameness are reported. \r\nObjectives : Our aims were as follows: 1) to characterise CT abnormalities in horses with tarsal lameness; 2) to compare CT findings with those from other imaging techniques; and 3) to assess whether CT can help to diagnose tarsal pathology. \r\nStudy design : Retrospective case series. \r\nMethods : Computed tomography of the tarsus was performed on 15 horses (n = 17 joints) with tarsal lameness. The horses were divided into 3 groups depending on the reason for CT examination, as follows: 1) other imaging techniques were inconclusive; 2) evaluation of a fracture; or 3) other imaging techniques showed tarsal lesions, and CT was performed to assess whether additional lesions were present. \r\nResults : Group 1 included 7 horses. Lesions detected with CT included subchondral cyst-like lesions (2 horses); an osteolytic lesion in the cochlea tibiae (one horse); degenerative changes of the distal tarsal joints (2 horses); osteolytic lesions tarsometatarsal joint (one horse); and sclerosis of the third tarsal bone with a lesion of the tarsometatarsal interosseous ligament (one horse). In this group, CT provided information on the character and extent of the lesion that was not available with other imaging techniques. Computed tomography revealed more information about the extent and complexity of the fracture than radiography in Group 2, whereas CT did not provide extra information in Group 3. \r\nConclusions : Focal lesions located between the tarsal bone surfaces are difficult or even impossible to detect with radiography and ultrasonography, but they can be detected and characterised with CT. \r\nPotential relevance : Computed tomography of the tarsus should be considered when radiography and ultrasonography are inconclusive, or for further evaluation of tarsal fractures.","lang":"eng"}]}

The indoor detector is based on the depth and amplitude image of a time-of-flight camera. Using this multi-modal information, flames can be detected very accurately by fast changing depth and amplitude disorder detection. In order to detect the fast changing depth, depth differences between consecutive frames are accumulated over time. Regions which have multiple pixels with a high accumulated depth difference are labeled as candidate flame regions. Simultaneously, the amplitude disorder is also investigated. Regions with high accumulative amplitude differences and high values in all detail images of the amplitude image its discrete wavelet transform, are also labeled as candidate flame regions. Finally, if one of the depth and amplitude candidate flame regions overlap, fire alarm is given. The outdoor detector, on the other hand, only differs from the indoor detector in one of its multi-modal inputs. As depth maps are unreliable in outdoor environments, the outdoor detector uses a visual flame detector instead of the fast changing depth detection. Experiments show that the proposed detectors have an average flame detection rate of 94% with no false positive detections.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"2656FCBE-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher"}

In most cases, interpretation of the simulation results is done on ad hoc complex databases based on so-called expert knowledge. As such, the interpretation of the results becomes difficult. In this study, interpretation of the WWTP simulation results is aided by the means of principal component analysis (PCA). The main influencing factors were found to be the influent flow rate and load, and the settler performance in terms of the non-settleable fraction of the biomass. A PCA analysis indicated three principal components. The first principal component explained 37% of the total variance and contains most of the information on nitrogen removal. The second principal component (PC2) explains 20% of the total variance and can be considered as a measure of the secondary settler performance. The third principal component (PC3) explains 17% of the total variance and mostly contains information on the different flow rates in the WWTP (influent flow rate, nitrate recycle flow rate, sludge recycle flow rate and waste flow rate)."}],"page_first":"4154","citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Van Hulle S, Ciocci C.

Paired with a right for consumers to withdraw from the contract, this legal instrument seeks to protect consumers against superior skilled and knowledgeable sellers thus restoring the balance of interests. According to prior literature, cooling-off periods also serve an economic function by moderating the abuse of market power, by mitigating problems of hidden characteristics, and by promoting consumer choice. If their drawbacks-mainly the creation of consumer moral hazard and shifting of risk to the seller-can be contained, cooling-off periods are hence supposed to yield efficiency gains. By thinking out of this box, the present paper showcases that cooling-off periods also establish the perverse incentive for the seller to increase consumer compliance to a level which outlasts the cooling-off period. I argue that inevitably occurring psychological factors and transaction costs from the cooling-off regime amplify each other, thus creating a hard-lock status-quo bias. Based on behavioural insights and transaction cost theory, I predict that an inefficiently high number of consumers will enter into a doorstep contract and that, at the same time, the number of cancelled contracts will be inefficiently low. Consequently, I propose to change the default inherent in current cooling-off regimes from presumed consent to presumed withdrawal in order to debias consumers' withdrawal decision."}],"author":[{"full_name":"Höppner, Sven","id":"318B989C-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Höppner","first_name":"Sven"}],"extern":"1","article_type":"original","publisher":"Springer","subject":["Law and Political Science"],"classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","title":"The unintended consequence of doorstep consumer protection: surprise, reciprocation, and consistency","type":"journal_article","date_approved":"2014-10-02T10:46:37Z","issue":"2","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"page_last":"276","department":[{"_id":"RE02","tree":[{"_id":"RE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:39:12Z","publication_abbreviation":"EJLE","status":"public","publication_status":"published","creator":{"id":"318B989C-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS"}

The current study examined whether observation of video primes could impact appraisals of potential back stressing activities, and whether this relationship was moderated by individual differences in pain-related fear. Participants viewed a video prime in which back-stressing activity was associated with pain and injury. Both before and after viewing the prime, participants provided pain and harm ratings of standardized movements drawn from the Photograph of Daily Activities Scale (PHODA). Results indicated that observational learning occurred for participants with high levels of pain-related fear but not for low fear participants. Specifically, following prime exposure, high fear participants showed elevated pain appraisals of activity images whereas low fear participants did not. High fear participants appraised the PHODA-M images as significantly more harmful regardless of prime exposure.

The first section examines the underlying moral dilemma that results from the necessity of balancing the principle of respect for persons with the obligation to help people in desperate need. We argue for the rejection of a radical utilitarian approach but also question the appropriateness of a categorical prohibition. Section two aims to strike a fair balance between the competing interests at stake and to define the conditions under which organ harvest from mentally incompetents might be morally acceptable. To this end, we morally assess the main requirements that have been put forward to allow organ removal from incompetent donors. We conclude that the current Belgian legislation is far too permissive and that national regulations that do not permit the harvest of non-regenerable organs from mentally incompetents in exceptional circumstances are too restrictive. On the basis of this discussion, we propose a number of guiding principles for decision-making in this area.","lang":"eng"}],"page_first":"101","citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Van Assche K, Genicot G, Sterckx S.

This paper describes the application of a CF methodology, based on lifecycle assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for Flemish pigmeat production using the Publicly Available Specification methodology (PAS2050, BSI 2011), which is at present the most developed method and relevant within the agricultural and horticultural sector. Both primary and secondary data have been used to model the meat system through a chain approach. The results are reported using the functional unit of 1kg of deboned pigmeat; and range from 4.8 to 6.4kg CO2 eq./kg of deboned pig meat. A sensitivity analysis has been executed on changes in herd and feed characteristics. The results have been compared with other studies on the CF of pigmeat in the European Union and with CF studies on milk and beef production in Flanders. Furthermore, two major hotspots in the CF have been defined: the composition and production of feed, and manure production and usage. It is important to mention that the CF is a good indicator for GHG emissions, but it is not an indicator for environmental impact in general. This paper helps to fill the void in the CF literature which existed around pigmeat products and to define a benchmark for CF of pigmeat.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","intvolume":"        12","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-3199135","_version":4,"external_id":{"isi":"000332060400004"},"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Jacobsen R, Vandermeulen V, Van Huylenbroeck G, Gellynck X.

As a specific example, we consider the respiratory data. The NIMRAD can be applied for quantitative description of data recorded for complex systems in cases where the adequate model is absent and the treatment procedure should not contain any uncontrollable error. The theoretical developments are applied to signals measured from the respiratory system by means of the forced oscillation technique based on non-invasive lung function test. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for developing new diagnosis tools, we apply NIMRAD on two different respiratory data sets, namely from a healthy subject and from a patient diagnosed with asthma. The results are promising and suggest that NIMRAD could be further tailored and used for specific clinical applications.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"         8","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-3198353","page_first":"1517","external_id":{"isi":"000344621800011"},"citation":{"fwo":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Nigmatullin, RR, Clara-Mihaela Ionescu, and D Baleanu. 2014. “Nimrad: Novel Technique for Respiratory Data Treatment.” <i>Signal Image and Video Processing</i> 8 (8): 1517–1532.</div>\n","apa":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Nigmatullin, R., Ionescu, C.-M., &#38; Baleanu, D.

Various authors have explained this phenomenon as carelessness or bias on the part of the census-takers. Women's work was of little interest to the authorities and census officials focused their efforts upon the activities of the head of household. While source triangulation can be a useful tool for uncovering 'hidden' employment of women, it is often a complex and time-consuming process. In this article we outline an alternative to deal with the issue of missing occupations of single women in censuses by exploring their living arrangements. We identify four aspects of co-residence that can highlight the roles played within the household by single women without registered employment: their relation to the head of the household, and that individual's occupation, property and marital status. Comparing data from the 1814 population census regarding two social agro-systems and the city of Bruges, we argue that occupational titles of single women were not randomly omitted by the census officials, but reflect the embeddedness of these women in the family economy and household. While we do not refute recent research that stresses single women's economic independence during the long eighteenth century, our findings suggest that for a subset of singles this was not the case. We claim that by studying registered labour only, the historical picture of single women's work is biased or at the very least incomplete."}],"cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","user_id":"2656FCBE-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","extern":0,"author":[{"full_name":"Devos, Isabelle","id":"F4F542F2-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Devos","first_name":"Isabelle","orcid":"0000-0002-6111-711X"},{"full_name":"De Langhe, Sofie","first_name":"Sofie","id":"F93796A8-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"De Langhe"},{"first_name":"Christa","last_name":"Matthys","id":"F73FCFE6-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Matthys, Christa"}],"article_type":"original","locked":1,"accept":1,"doi":"10.1080/1081602X.2013.875482","date_created":"2013-08-26T15:01:27Z","year":"2014","has_main_file":1,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["1081-602X"]},"volume":19,"_id":"4121696","file":[{"relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2014-12-12T13:25:16Z","content_type":"application/pdf","date_created":"2013-08-26T15:01:27Z","file_name":"Lost_in_registrationfinal.pdf","file_id":"4121699","access_level":"local","file_size":"565575"}],"date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:43:10Z","project":[{"_id":"Grant Number B/07775/02: Analyse van de bestaansstrategieën van nooit gehuwde vrouwen tijdens de vroegmoderne tijd.

Charles Darwin used the metaphor and the underlying analogy to frame his ideas about evolution and its main driving mechanism into a full-fledged theory. Because the metaphor turned out to be such a powerful epistemic tool, Darwin naturally assumed that he could also employ it as an educational tool to inform his contemporaries about his findings. Moreover, by using the metaphor Darwin was able to bring his theory in accordance with both the dominant  philosophy of science in his time and the respected tradition of natural theology. However, as he introduced his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the origin of species in 1859, the metaphor also turned out to have a serious downside. Because of its intentional overtones, his contemporaries systematically misunderstood his metaphor not as a natural mechanism causing evolution to occur but as an agent who works towards particular ends. The difference in success between natural selection as an epistemic tool and its failure as an educational tool is labelled as a paradox. We explain the paradox from a cognitive perspective and discuss the implications for teaching evolution."}],"intvolume":"        23","issue":"4","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"page_last":"808","department":[{"_id":"LW01","tree":[{"_id":"LW"},{"_id":"UGent"}]},{"tree":[{"_id":"PP"},{"_id":"UGent"}],"_id":"PP06"}],"has_message":"0","classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","title":"From ends to causes (and back again) by metaphor: the paradox of natural selection","type":"journal_article","subject":["Biology and Life Sciences"],"date_approved":"2013-08-30T10:55:33Z","has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"F9DAC3F0-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"SCIENCE & EDUCATION","publication_abbreviation":"Sci.

Until now, however, no studies have disentangled the influence of the appraisals of expectancy and proximity on emotions. We experimentally manipulated each of these variables in 3 slot machine experiments and measured emotions via differences in motivation (i.e., the tendency to repair the goal incongruence) and feelings (i.e., disappointment, frustration, and anger). The experiments consisted of a series of trials that each started with the sequential presentation of 3 symbols. In case of a win trial, all symbols were equal (e. g., AAA) and the participant gained 10 cents; in case of a loss trial, one or more of the symbols differed and the participant gained 0 cents. Three different loss trials were compared: unexpected proximal ones (e. g., AAB), expected proximal ones (e. g., ABA), and expected distal ones (e. g., ABC). The tendency to repair was measured online via behavior as well as retrospectively via self-reports; feelings were measured retrospectively (Experiments 1 and 2) or online (Experiment 3). Unexpected losses seemed to increase the tendency to repair as well as feelings of disappointment (in all experiments) and feelings of frustration and anger (in Experiments 1 and 3). Proximal losses increased only the tendency to repair (in all experiments).

The results showed that in Western cultures, people perceived choice in a linear way as either a burden or a blessing, whereas in Chinese culture, such opposition between perspectives did not appear, and individuals generally saw choice as both burden and blessing simultaneously. In Western cultures, high dispositional NFC was strongly associated with viewing choice-as-a-burden, whereas Chinese respondents with a high need for closure perceived choice as a blessing and a burden simultaneously. The Singaporean results were similar to the Western pattern. These findings are discussed in terms of the NFC literature and cultural differences in dialectic versus differentiation thinking styles.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"        49","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4126590","external_id":{"isi":"000335627400010"},"keyword":["Individual differences","Need for closure","Dialectical thinking","Cross-cultural","Choice","CAPACITY","COGNITION","SELF","CONTRADICTION"],"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Roets A, Soetens B, Au E, Guan Y.

To efficiently manage pike, information is needed on its spatial and temporal patterns of migration. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of adult pike migration and which environmental variables influenced migration. From December 2010, we followed 15 pike for 1 year by use of radio telemetry in the River Yser, a typical lowland river characterised by anthropogenic impacts such as artificial embankments. Pike migrated most in February and March, which could indicate they frequented spawning habitat in this period. Four environmental variables significantly affected pike migration, ranging from the location where pike were observed (strongest effect), over water temperature and flow to diel water temperature change (weakest effect). The relation between migration and the location where pike were observed could demonstrate that pike preferred specific regions in the river. Increasing water temperature triggered migration for both sexes, and males started migrating at lower temperatures than females, which suggests that males start migrating earlier. This was the only substantial difference observed between male and female pike migration. The results suggest that migration was inhibited by high flow, as no migration was observed at high flow. River managers can use this information to efficiently manage their pike populations, for example, by removing or temporarily opening hydraulic structures like valves, weirs and sluices. This may facilitate access to suitable habitats at moments pike needs these habitats to fulfil its life cycle.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","intvolume":"        23"}

One path to this end is introducing practices to manage different forms of customer engagement behaviors (CEBs). To develop more effective and efficient CEB management practices, this research proposes and empirically tests a theoretical model on managerial and psychological processes to encourage CEBs that are embedded in a broader network of customers and stakeholders. Based on qualitative and quantitative studies in nursing homes, we demonstrate that organizational support and overall service quality toward significant others influence some forms of CEBs—more particularly feedback and positive word of mouth (WOM) behaviors—through customer affect toward the organization. It is interesting to note that customer affect toward the organization encouragesWOMbehaviors, while it discourages feedback behaviors. Conversely, managerial processes that increase customer role readiness—such as organizational socialization and support from other customers—were found to have a positive impact on all forms of CEBs. This research helps managers of nursing homes and other services with a broad network of customers and stakeholders to improve existing CEB management practices and develop new CEB management practices that are beneficial for the firm and its stakeholders."}],"intvolume":"        17","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4110771","citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Verleye K, Gemmel P, Rangarajan D.

We hypothesize that the regional level of globalization is a moderating factor in the relationship between SRH and educational attainment. Using retrospective data from Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia, the associations between SRH (eight indicators), educational attainment, and globalization were examined using multilevel logistic regression analysis. It was found that the model fit for every SRH outcome indicator increased significantly after including the interaction between globalization and educational attainment, supporting the hypothesis. Depending on the level of globalization, three types of relationships between education and SRH were found: (1) for the indicators “more than four children,” “intercourse before 17 years,” “first child before 20 years,” and “one or more child died” education is risk-decreasing, and the reduction is stronger in more globalized regions; (2) for the indicators “condom use at last intercourse” and “current contraceptive use” education is risk-decreasing, and the reduction is stronger in less globalized regions; (3) for the indicators “HIV positive” and “more than four lifetime sexual partners” education is risk increasing, but only in less globalized regions. In conclusion, these effects are related to three types of access: (1) access to services, (2) access to information, and (3) access to sexual networks. The findings highlight the relevance of globalization when analyzing the association between SRH and education, and the importance of structural factors in the development of effective SRH promotion interventions."}],"user_id":"2656FCBE-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","_version":4,"external_id":{"isi":"000329425100016"},"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Van Stam M-A, Michielsen K, Stroeken K, Zijlstra BJ.

Accordingly, the results of logistic regression analyses indicate that place detachment is not significantly related to risk perception but rather to site-specific concerns such as a perceived decrease in property values on the one hand, and wider environmental stressors such as traffic congestion on the other.

Previous research, mainly outside the nursing setting, found that social exchange affects employees’ work-related attitudes.\r\nMethod: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 217 nurses and nursing assistants to test and refine a model linking POS, LMX, PCB with job satisfaction, trust and turnover intentions.\r\nResults: Hierarchical multiple linear regression revealed that POS, PCB and LMX explained significant variance in all three retention factors: job satisfaction (adjusted R² = 0.502), trust (adjusted R² = 0.462) and turnover intentions (adjusted R² = 0.196). POS and PCB predicted most strongly job satisfaction (P < 0.001) and trust (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). LMX predicted most strongly intention to leave (P < 0.01).\r\nConclusion: In our study, POS, the quality of LMX and PCB were strongly related to job satisfaction, trust and turnover intentions.\r\nImplications for nursing management: Nursing managers and leaders should recognize the importance of social exchange within their organisation to build trust, satisfy and retain scarce nurses and nursing assistants.","lang":"eng"}],"external_id":{"isi":"000340596300004"},"page_first":"563","keyword":["PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACT BREACH","JOB-SATISFACTION","PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT","LEADERSHIP","EMPOWERMENT","COMMITMENT","VIOLATION","CARE","RECIPROCITY","SHORTAGES","intent to leave","nurse retention","satisfaction","social exchange","trust"],"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Trybou J, De Pourcq K, Paeshuyse M, Gemmel P.

Background Theoretically, employees will reciprocate received beneficial treatment with positive attitudes and behaviour. Recently, it has been shown that this principle may be more complex than originally anticipated. Design A quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used. The quality of social exchange and identification was scored by the involved registered nurses and nurse assistants; in-role and extra-role behaviour was rated by the head nurse. Methods The survey was administered to nurses and nurse assistants (n=196) working in five Belgian nursing homes. Data were collected from February-March 2012. Pearson correlation analyses, t-test analyses and hierarchical regression were used to analyse the data. Results Our results showed no relationship between perceived organizational support and leader-member exchange and in-role behaviour. A positive relationship was found between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour and a trend towards significance between leader-member exchange and extra-role behaviour. Organizational and professional identification moderated the relationship between perceived organizational support and extra-role behaviour. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the importance of social exchange to nurses and nurse assistants and therefore nursing administrators and leaders. When registered nurses and nurse assistants perceive high-quality social exchange, they are more likely to go the extra mile on behalf of the organization. Fostering social identification could enhance this."}],"intvolume":"        70","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4095651","keyword":["PERSPECTIVE","RECIPROCITY","CARE","NURSES","COMMITMENT","SOCIAL-EXCHANGE","JOB-SATISFACTION","extra-role behaviour","PREDICTORS","VALUES","leader-member exchange","professional identification","in-role behaviour","nursing","organizational identification","organizational support"],"external_id":{"isi":"000331693000012"},"page_first":"373","citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Trybou J, Gemmel P, Pauwels Y, Henninck C, Clays E.

Before testing Kirby's palpation technique to locate the subtalar joint axis in cadavers, it was important to develop and test the experimental methods in a mechanical model in which the exact location of the hinge joint can be controlled.\r\nMethods: Four testers determined the hinge joint location and moved it through its range of motion, capturing the movement of the joint axis using a kinematic model. The joint axis location was determined and validated by comparing the actual hinge joint location on the mechanical model with the location determined by the palpation technique described by Kirby in 1987 and the location determined by the helical joint axis method using three-dimensional kinematic data.\r\nResults: The overall angles result in mean slopes and intersections of 87 degrees and 92 mm, 86 degrees and 97 mm, 85 degrees and 92 mm, and 88 degrees and 91 mm for testers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Testers 1 and 3 were able to determine the location to 1 degrees and 1 mm accuracy, tester 2 to 0 degrees and 4 mm, and tester 4 to 2 degrees and 2 mm compared with the kinematic data.\r\nConclusions: The technique of determining the points of no rotation as described by Kirby could be validated by using a three-dimensional kinematic model to determine the helical axis.","lang":"eng"}],"file":[{"file_name":"APMS_email_attachment_SMC_1402330775_1.pdf","date_created":"2013-07-09T09:39:27Z","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2014-08-07T10:17:31Z","relation":"main_file","file_size":"336552","access_level":"local","file_id":"4411686"}],"_id":"4098174","locked":1,"accept":1,"date_created":"2013-07-09T09:39:27Z","year":"2014","volume":104,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["8750-7315"]},"creator":{"id":"F932F8BE-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION","date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:43:13Z","publication_abbreviation":"J.

A consensus workshop organised by ADEE in 2008, set the benchmarks for the knowledge and competences a modern dental practitioner must possess with regard to implant dentistry, as well as defined undergraduate and postgraduate pathways for the acquisition of these competences. Today, 5 years later, there exist several challenges for the implementation of these benchmarks in both undergraduate curricula but also post-graduation educational pathways.\r\nMethods: A consensus workshop was organised by ADEE, bringing together 48 opinion leaders, including academic teachers of all disciplines related to implant dentistry, specialists, representatives of relevant scientific and professional associations, as well as industry delegates. The objectives of the workshop were to evaluate the existing scientific literature, reported experience and best practices in order to identify potential and limitations for the implementation of implant dentistry in the undergraduate curriculum, as well produce recommendations for the optimal educational structures for post-graduate programmes and continuing professional development.\r\nResults: The scientific committee conducted two European-wide questionnaire surveys to better document the current state of education in implant dentistry. Upon completion of the surveys, reviewers were appointed to produce three scientific review papers, identifying current achievements and future challenges. Finally, during the 3 days of the workshop, all the evidence was reviewed and the main conclusions and recommendations that were adopted by all participants are reported in the present Consensus Paper.\r\nConclusions: Implementation of implant dentistry in the undergraduate curriculum has improved significantly, but still lags behind the benchmarks set in 2008 and the diversity between institutions remains big. At the post-graduation level, there is currently a wide diversity of courses and pathways towards competences related to implant dentistry and there is at present a great need for quality assurance, as well as standardisation and transparency of the learning outcomes.","lang":"eng"}],"author":[{"full_name":"Mattheos, Nikos","last_name":"Mattheos","first_name":"Nikos"},{"full_name":"De Bruyn, Hugo","first_name":"Hugo","last_name":"De Bruyn","id":"F73EAFBC-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","orcid":"0000-0003-0200-9546"},{"last_name":"Hultin","first_name":"Margareta","full_name":"Hultin, Margareta"},{"full_name":"Jepsen, Soren","first_name":"Soren","last_name":"Jepsen"},{"full_name":"Klinge, Bjorn","first_name":"Bjorn","last_name":"Klinge"},{"first_name":"Sebastiaan","last_name":"Koole","id":"F7863468-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","orcid":"0000-0002-0555-6396","full_name":"Koole, Sebastiaan"},{"full_name":"Sanz, Mariano","last_name":"Sanz","first_name":"Mariano"},{"first_name":"Cemal","last_name":"Ucer","full_name":"Ucer, Cemal"},{"first_name":"Klaus ","last_name":"Lang","full_name":"Lang, Klaus "}],"extern":0,"article_type":"original","locked":1,"doi":"10.1111/eje.12075","accept":1,"has_main_file":1,"year":"2014","date_created":"2014-02-04T10:40:19Z","volume":18,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["1600-0579"]},"file":[{"date_created":"2014-02-04T10:40:19Z","file_name":"eje12075.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2015-11-12T15:34:33Z","relation":"main_file","file_size":"306532","access_level":"local","file_id":"4262604"}],"_id":"4262546","date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:43:26Z","publication_abbreviation":"Eur.

There remains, however, a need for prospective studies, with long-term assessment of multiple outcomes. \r\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, single-centre observational study of 16 women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (n = 12) or 46,XY disorders of sex development (n = 4). All women underwent an outpatient vaginal dilation program supervised by a psychologist and physiotherapist. At baseline (TO), stop of treatment (T1) and 1 year follow-up (T2), semistructured interviews, and validated questionnaires assessed sexual function and distress, self-esteem, vaginal perceptions, and health-related quality of life. Gynecological examinations evaluated vaginal dimensions. \r\nRESULTS: Ten women completed the program, 3 are still in the program, and dilation failed in 3 and chose vaginoplasty. Sixty-nine percent reached a normal vaginal length (>= 6.5 cm) in 5.8 +/- 3.3 months. Seventy percent were sexually active with pleasurable experiences at Ti, 57% at T2. The significant decrease in sexual distress at Ti (P <.05) was followed by a nonsignificant increase at T2. Depressive mood symptomatology remained high at Ti and T2, related to loss of bodily integrity and fertility. The majority refused further psychological counseling. \r\nCONCLUSION: Vaginal dilation treatment should remain the cornerstone of treatment in women with vaginal hypoplasia. However, the diagnosis remains to have a negative impact on emotional well-being in the long term. The role of psychological intervention as both a primary and adjuvant treatment needs clear evaluation."}],"cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","intvolume":"       211","_id":"4262712","file":[{"relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2014-11-27T16:28:46Z","content_type":"application/pdf","file_name":"Vaginal.pdf","date_created":"2014-02-04T11:34:02Z","file_id":"5765382","access_level":"local","file_size":"1179365"}],"accept":1,"doi":"10.1016/j.ajog.2014.03.051","locked":1,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["0002-9378"]},"volume":211,"has_main_file":1,"date_created":"2014-02-04T11:34:02Z","year":"2014","has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"00E142DC-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY","publication_abbreviation":"Am.

Much of the current therapy is focused on input mechanisms (treating peripheral elements such as muscles and joints) and output mechanisms (addressing motor control), while there is less attention to processing (central) mechanisms. In addition to the compelling evidence for impaired motor control of spinal muscles in patients with CSP, there is increasing evidence that central mechanisms (ie, hyperexcitability of the central nervous system and brain abnormalities) play a role in CSP. Hence, treatments for CSP should address not only peripheral dysfunctions but also the brain. Therefore, a modern neuroscience approach, comprising therapeutic pain neuroscience education followed by cognition-targeted motor control training, is proposed.

{"intvolume":"       224","abstract":[{"lang":"eng","text":"Although a full understanding of the hepatic circulation is one of the keys to successfully perform liver surgery and to elucidate liver pathology, relatively little is known about the functional organization of the liver vasculature. Therefore, we materialized and visualized the human hepatic vasculature at different scales, and performed a morphological analysis by combining vascular corrosion casting with novel micro-computer tomography (CT) and image analysis techniques. A human liver vascular corrosion cast was obtained by simultaneous resin injection in the hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV). A high resolution (110 mu m) micro-CT scan of the total cast allowed gathering detailed macrovascular data. Subsequently, a mesocirculation sample (starting at generation 5; 88 x 68 x 80 mm(3)) and a microcirculation sample (terminal vessels including sinusoids; 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.7 mm(3)) were dissected and imaged at a 71-mu m and 2.6-mu m resolution, respectively. Segmentations and 3D reconstructions allowed quantifying the macro- and mesoscale branching topology, and geometrical features of HA, PV and hepatic venous trees up to 13 generations (radii ranging from 13.2 mm to 80 mu m; lengths from 74.4 mm to 0.74 mm), as well as microvascular characteristics (mean sinusoidal radius of 6.63 mu m). Combining corrosion casting and micro-CT imaging allows quantifying the branching topology and geometrical features of hepatic trees using a multiscale approach from the macro- down to the microcirculation. This may lead to novel insights into liver circulation, such as internal blood flow distributions and anatomical consequences of pathologies (e.g. cirrhosis)."}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","_version":7,"external_id":{"isi":"000332431000012"},"page_first":"509","keyword":["RAT","ANGIOGENESIS","HEMODYNAMICS","IMPACT","ARTERIAL","PERFUSION","TRANSPLANTATION","MODEL","BLOOD-FLOW","HEPATIC MICROCIRCULATION","tree analysis","morphology","image processing","hepatic vasculature","3D reconstruction"],"handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4261149","author":[{"full_name":"Debbaut, Charlotte","orcid":"0000-0003-1962-238X","id":"0BE4CA0A-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Debbaut","first_name":"Charlotte"},{"full_name":"Segers, Patrick","orcid":"0000-0003-3870-3409","first_name":"Patrick","id":"F4A2EB1A-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Segers"},{"first_name":"Pieter","last_name":"Cornillie","id":"F67E7CE2-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Cornillie, Pieter"},{"first_name":"Christophe","last_name":"Casteleyn","full_name":"Casteleyn, Christophe"},{"id":"F5FCFA0A-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Dierick","first_name":"Manuel","full_name":"Dierick, Manuel"},{"first_name":"Wim","last_name":"Laleman","full_name":"Laleman, Wim"},{"full_name":"Monbaliu, Diethard","first_name":"Diethard","last_name":"Monbaliu"}],"article_type":"original","year":"2014","has_main_file":1,"date_created":"2014-02-03T12:15:47Z","publication_identifier":{"issn":["0021-8782"]},"volume":224,"locked":"1","urn":"urn:whatever-42611498","accept":"1","doi":"10.1111/joa.12156","_id":"4261149","file":[{"relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2017-06-01T11:59:04Z","content_type":"application/pdf","file_name":"JAnat_Debbaut_submitted_final.pdf","date_created":"2014-02-03T12:15:47Z","file_id":"4261156","file_size":"1121063","access_level":"open_access","creator":null,"open_access":1}],"publication_status":"published","status":"public","date_updated":"2017-06-01T11:59:05Z","publication_abbreviation":"J.

Participants performed a speeded dot detection task with dots appearing left or right, while maintaining digits or letters in working memory. Just before presentation of the dot, these digits or letters were used as central cues. These experiments show that the \"attentional SNARC-effect\" (where SNARC is the spatial-numerical association of response codes) is not observed when only the lastly perceived number cue-and no serially ordered sequence of cues-is maintained in working memory (Experiment 1). It is only when multiple items (numbers in Experiment 2; letters in Experiment 3) are stored in working memory in a serially organized way that the attentional cueing effect is observed as a function of serial working memory position. These observations suggest that the \"attentional SNARC-effect\" is strongly working memory based.

Standard monitoring measures (tourist surveys and counting and tracking techniques) are not sufficient to accomplish this task, in particular for off-road travel. This article predicts tourists' spatial use patterns through an alternative approach: park accessibility measurement. Naismith's rule and geographical information system's anisotropic cost analysis are integrated into the modeling process, which results in a more realistic measure of off-road accessibility than that provided by other measures. The method is applied to a mountainous United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Site in northwest Yunnan Province, China, where there is increasing concern about potential impacts of unregulated tourist use. Based on the assumption that accessibility tends to attract more tourists, a spatial pattern of predicted off-road use by tourists is derived. This pattern provides information that can help park managers develop strategies that are effective for both tourism management and species conservation.","lang":"eng"}],"cc_license":"I have retained and own the full copyright for this publication","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","intvolume":"        34","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4256366","_version":3,"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Yang M, Vancoillie F, Liu M, De Wulf R, Hens L, Ou X.

Here, we compared the methanotroph community in paddy soils sampled in Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Italy, focusing on the distance-decay relationship. We used the pmoA gene as marker for methanotroph diversity in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, microarray and pyrosequencing approaches. We could observe a significant increase of -diversity with geographical distance across continents (12000km). Measured environmental parameters explained only a small amount of data variation, and we found no evidence for dispersal limitation.

Also, γH2AX foci DR curves were obtained following exposure to doses ranging from 0 to 0.5 Gy of either γ-rays or neutrons. Foci kinetics for lymphocytes for a single donor exposed to 0.5 Gy γ-rays or neutrons were studied up to 24 hours post-irradiation.\r\nResults: Micronuclei yields following neutron exposure were consistently higher compared to that from 60Co γ-rays. All MN yields were over-dispersed compared to a Poisson distribution. Over-dispersion was higher after neutron irradiation for all doses > 0.1 Gy. Up to 4 hours post-irradiation lower yields of neutron-induced γH2AX foci were observed. Between 4 and 24 hours the numbers of foci from neutrons were consistently higher than that from γ-rays. The half-live of foci disappearance is only marginally longer for neutrons compared to that from γ-rays. Foci formations were more likely to be over-dispersed for neutron irradiations.\r\nConclusion: Although neutrons are more effective to induce MN, the absolute number of induced γH2AX foci are less at first compared to γ-rays. With time neutron-induced foci are more persistent. These findings are helpful for using γH2AX foci in biodosimetry and to understand the repair of neutron-induced cellular damage."}],"cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","extern":0,"author":[{"last_name":"Vandersickel","id":"F7DEC524-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Veerle","full_name":"Vandersickel, Veerle"},{"last_name":"Beukes","first_name":"Philip","full_name":"Beukes, Philip"},{"first_name":"Bram","last_name":"Van Bockstaele","id":"F95B578C-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Van Bockstaele, Bram"},{"last_name":"Depuydt","id":"213A0AFA-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Julie","full_name":"Depuydt, Julie"},{"full_name":"Vral, Anne","last_name":"Vral","id":"F475A11E-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Anne"},{"first_name":"Jacobus","last_name":"Slabbert","full_name":"Slabbert, Jacobus"}],"article_type":"original","alternative_title":["Induction and disappearance of gamma H2AX foci and formation of micronuclei after exposure of human lymphocytes to Co-60 gamma-rays and p(66) + Be(40) neutrons"],"locked":1,"accept":1,"doi":"10.3109/09553002.2014.860252","date_created":"2014-01-31T14:50:38Z","year":"2014","publication_identifier":{"issn":["0955-3002"]},"volume":90,"_id":"4259156","file":[{"file_size":"949242","access_level":"local","file_id":"5962672","date_created":"2014-01-31T14:50:38Z","file_name":"Vandersickel_et_al_2014_IJRB_MNi_and_H2AXfoci.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2015-05-21T12:32:37Z","relation":"main_file"}],"date_updated":"2016-12-19T15:43:25Z","publication_abbreviation":"Int.

This assessment was performed based on both biometric and geometric shape data, with the latter relying on outline based elliptic Fourier analysis. The fixation and mounting effect on the total length and shape of newly hatched larvae of D. labrax was tested for four fixation treatments: (1) 8% formalin, (2) 70% ethanol, (3) 8% formalin for 48h and then to 70% ethanol and (4) 3% phosphate-buffered glutaraldehyde. The analyses showed that no significant size and shape effect was observed on anaesthetized specimens 5months post-fixation in glutaraldehyde, and that the glycerol mounting process of specimens fixed in glutaraldehyde provided the best results for further ontogenetic qualitative and quantitative analysis. The protocol proved to be sufficiently sensitive to even quantify and visualize subtle pre-fixation shape differences originating from a different egg batch.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","_version":5,"keyword":["geometric morphometrics","fixative","larvae","outline","shape","GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS","FORMALIN CONCENTRATION","ENGRAULIS-MORDAX","NORTHERN ANCHOVY","PRESERVATION","FIXATION","LENGTH","ETHANOL","FISHES","REVOLUTION"],"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Nikolakakis S, Bossier P, Kanlis G, Dierckens K, Adriaens D.

The goal of this paper is to analyse the behaviour of the gas-to-dust mass ratio (G/D) of local Universe galaxies over a wide metallicity range. We especially focus on the low-metallicity part of the G/D vs metallicity relation and investigate several explanations for the observed relation and scatter.\r\nMethods. We assembled a total of 126 galaxies, covering a 2 dex metallicity range and with 30% of the sample with 12 + log(O/H) <= 8.0. We homogeneously determined the dust masses with a semi-empirical dust model including submm constraints. The atomic and molecular gas masses have been compiled from the literature. We used two X-CO scenarios to estimate the molecular gas mass: the Galactic conversion factor, X-CO,X-MW, and a X-CO that depends on the metallicity X-CO,X-Z (proportional to Z(-2)). We modelled the observed trend of the G/D with metallicity using two simple power laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken power law. Correlations with morphological type, stellar masses, star formation rates, and specific star formation rates are also discussed. We then compared the observed evolution of the G/D with predictions from several chemical evolution models and explored different physical explanations for the observed scatter in the G/D values.\r\nResults. We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters, metallicity is the main physical property of the galaxy driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus metallicity relation cannot be represented by a single power law with a slope of -1 over the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for metallicities lower than similar to 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D values for a given metallicity: in metallicity bins of similar to 0.1 dex, the dispersion around the mean value is similar to 0.37 dex. On average, the broken power law reproduces the observed G/D best compared to the two power laws (slope of -1 or free) and provides estimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement of observed values of the G/D and its scatter with respect to metallicity with the predicted values of the three tested chemical evolution models allows us to infer that the scatter in the relation is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the different star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain size distributions, and chemical compositions across the sample.\r\nConclusions. Our results show that the chemical evolution of low-metallicity galaxies, traced by their G/D, strongly depends on their local internal conditions and individual histories. The large scatter in the observed G/D at a given metallicity reflects the impact of various processes occurring during the evolution of a galaxy. Despite the numerous degeneracies affecting them, disentangling these various processes is now the next step."}],"intvolume":"       563","page_count":"22","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4385014","keyword":["evolution","galaxies: dwarf","RADIO TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS","HERSCHEL REFERENCE SURVEY","MOLECULAR INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM","POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS","dust","extinction","COMPACT DWARF GALAXIES","STAR-FORMING GALAXIES","SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTION","CO-TO-H-2 CONVERSION FACTOR","GRAIN-SIZE DISTRIBUTION","LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD","galaxies: evolution","galaxies: ISM","infrared: ISM"],"external_id":{"isi":"000333798000031"},"_version":8,"file":[{"open_access":1,"file_id":"4386105","access_level":"open_access","creator":null,"file_size":"2166340","content_type":"application/pdf","date_created":"2014-05-16T11:42:11Z","file_name":"Remy-Ruyer_et_al._2014.pdf","relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2017-03-01T09:58:18Z"}],"article_number":"A31","_id":"4385014","volume":563,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["0004-6361"]},"date_created":"2014-05-16T11:42:11Z","has_main_file":1,"year":"2014","doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/201322803","accept":"1","locked":"1","urn":"urn:whatever-43850149","publication":"ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS","reviewer_tags":["PDF toegang: On author's personal website or institutional website or OAI compliant website"],"has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"F551D4EA-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"status":"public","publication_status":"published","publication_abbreviation":"Astron.

None of the exercises elicited high (>50% MVIC) EMG activity. Based on the results, a ranking was calculated of the exercises, with mean EMG levels between 2.2% +/- 1.24% (during internal rotation against resistance in 90 degrees of shoulder abduction) and 35.9% +/- 18.82% (during forward flexion in external rotation and supination) of MVIC. \r\nConclusion: This study describes a continuum of exercises with an increasing level of EMG activity in the BB. Exercises targeting the trapezius resulted in less loads on the biceps compared with exercises for the SA. In addition, exercises with an internal rotation component showed low activity in the BB. In general, the exercises meant to target the BB showed the highest levels of activity in the BB.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","_version":7,"external_id":{"isi":"000340721400014"},"page_first":"1315","keyword":["biceps pathological disorders","LONG HEAD","PART II","POSTERIOR LESIONS","SERRATUS ANTERIOR","IMPINGEMENT SYMPTOMS","PROGRAM","MUSCLE-ACTIVITY","ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS","SUPERIOR LABRUM ANTERIOR","DISABLED THROWING SHOULDER","SLAP lesions","electromyography","rehabilitation"],"handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-4388688","author":[{"full_name":"Cools, Ann","orcid":"0000-0002-8068-3854","first_name":"Ann","last_name":"Cools","id":"F5780AF2-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},{"orcid":"0000-0003-3482-3999","first_name":"Dorien","last_name":"Borms","id":"09025726-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Borms, Dorien"},{"full_name":"Cottens, Simon","first_name":"Simon","last_name":"Cottens"},{"full_name":"Himpe, Marcia","first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"Himpe"},{"full_name":"Meersdom, Stijn","first_name":"Stijn","last_name":"Meersdom"},{"first_name":"Barbara","last_name":"Cagnie","id":"F5BDF576-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Cagnie, Barbara"}],"article_type":"original","date_created":"2014-05-19T22:50:59Z","has_main_file":1,"year":"2014","publication_identifier":{"issn":["0363-5465"]},"volume":42,"locked":"1","accept":"1","doi":"10.1177/0363546514526692","_id":"4388688","file":[{"date_created":"2014-05-19T22:50:59Z","file_name":"cools_biceps_exercises_AJSM_2014.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2017-01-30T08:48:05Z","relation":"main_file","open_access":0,"file_size":"180052","creator":null,"access_level":"local","file_id":"6959624"}],"publication_status":"published","status":"public","date_updated":"2017-01-30T08:48:05Z","publication_abbreviation":"Am.

METHODS: PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature using different key word combinations related to FM, brain MRI, and central sensitization. Full-text reports fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: From the 61 articles that were identified, 22 met the inclusion criteria and achieved sufficient methodological quality. Overall, eight articles examined structural brain (VBM) changes in patients with FM, showing moderate evidence that central sensitization is correlated with gray matter volume decrease in specific brain regions (mainly anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex). However, global gray matter volume remains unchanged. A total of 13 articles evaluated brain activity (fMRI) in response to a nociceptive stimulus. Findings suggest a higher but similar pattern of activation of the pain matrix in FM patients compared to controls. There is also evidence of decreased functional connectivity in the descending pain-modulating system in FM patients. Overall, two articles examined intrinsic brain connectivity in FM patients with rs-fMRI. In conclusion, there is moderate evidence for a significant imbalance of the connectivity within the pain network during rest in patients with FM. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed a moderate evidence for region-specific changes in gray matter volume, a decreased functional connectivity in the descending pain-modulating system, and an increased activity in the pain matrix related to central sensitization. More research is needed to evaluate the cause-effect relationship\r\nM3  - S0049-0172(14)00002-X [pii];10.1016/j.semarthrit.2014.01.001 [doi]\r\nAD  - Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy, Ghent University, De Pintelaan 185 3B3, Ghent 9000, Belgium.

In this paper, we set up a low dimensional functional model that accounts for 70% of the variability in the expressive body movement responses to music. With the functional principal component analysis, we modeled individual body movements as a linear combination of a group average and a number of eigenfunctions. The group average and the eigenfunctions are common to all subjects and make up what we call the commonalities. An individual performance is then characterized by a set of scores (the individualities), one score per eigenfunction. The model is based on experimental data which finds high levels of coherence/consistency between participants when grouped according to musical education. This shows an ontogenetic effect. Participants without formal musical education focus on the torso for the expression of basic musical structure (tempo). Musically trained participants decode additional structural elements in the music and focus on body parts having more degrees of freedom (such as the hands). Our results confirm earlier studies that different body parts move differently along with the music."}],"file":[{"file_id":"6990904","file_size":"33833491","access_level":"local","content_type":"application/pdf","date_created":"2014-05-20T15:52:38Z","file_name":"06750704.pdf","relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2015-11-30T14:37:06Z"}],"_id":"4389477","locked":1,"doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305998","accept":1,"year":"2014","has_main_file":1,"date_created":"2014-05-20T15:52:38Z","volume":44,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["2168-2267"]}}

Besides, biofilms may be a hot spot for plasmid transfer, by which antibiotic resistance can be disseminated to potential foodborne pathogens. This study investigated biomass and plasmid transfer in dual-species (Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli) biofilm models relevant to the food industry. Two different configurations (flow-through and drip-flow) and two different inoculation procedures (donor-recipient and recipient-donor) were tested. The drip-flow configuration integrated stainless steel coupons in the setup while the flow-through configuration included a glass flow cell and silicone tubing. The highest biomass density [10 log (cells cm-(2))] was obtained in the silicone tubing when first the recipient strain was inoculated. High plasmid transfer ratios, up to 1/10 (transconjugants/total bacteria), were found. Depending on the order of inoculation, a difference in transfer efficiency between the biofilm models could be found. The ease by which the multiresistance plasmid was transferred highlights the importance of biofilms in the food industry as hot spots for the acquisition of multiresistance plasmids.

boson decaying to a W-boson pair at the LHC is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb(-1) and 19.4 fb(-1) collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4.3 standard deviations for m (H) = 125.6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m (H) = 125.6 GeV is times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J (P) = 0(+) hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J (P) = 2(+) or J (P) = 0(-) that decays to a W-boson pair. This result provides strong evidence for a Higgs-like boson decaying to a W-boson pair.","lang":"eng"}],"place":"NEW YORK","page_count":"86","issue":"1","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"department":[{"tree":[{"_id":"WE"},{"_id":"UGent"}],"_id":"WE05"}],"has_message":"0","classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","title":"Measurement of Higgs boson production and properties in the WW decay channel with leptonic final states","type":"journal_article","has_file":1,"publication":"JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS","publication_abbreviation":"J.

Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) have been suggested to protect against cachexia. We aimed to examine if echium oil, a plant source of n-3 FA, could reduce weight loss in H&N cancer patients undergoing radio(chemo) therapy with curative intent. \r\nMethods: In a double-blind trial, patients were randomly assigned to echium oil (intervention (I) group; 7.5 ml bis in die (b.i.d.), 235 mg/ml gamma-linolenic acid (ALA) + 95 mg/ml stearidonic acid (SDA) + 79 mg/ml.-linolenic acid (GLA)) or n-3 FA deficient sunflower oil high oleic (control (C) group; 7.5 ml b. i. d.) additional to standard nutritional support during treatment. Differences in percentage weight loss between both groups were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Erythrocyte FA profile, body composition, nutritional status and quality of life were collected. \r\nResults: Ninety-one eligible patients were randomised, of whom 83 were evaluable. Dietary supplement adherence was comparable in both groups (median, I: 87%, C: 81%). At week 4, the I group showed significantly increased values of erythrocyte n-3 eicosapentanoic acid (EPA, 14% vs -5%) and n-6 GLA (42% vs -20%) compared to the C group, without a significant change in n-6 arachidonic acid (AA, 2% vs -1%). Intention-to-treat analysis could not reveal a significant reduction in weight loss related to echium oil consumption (median weight loss, I: 8.9%, C: 7.6%). Also, no significant improvement was observed in the other evaluated anthropometric parameters. \r\nConclusions: Echium oil effectively increased erythrocyte EPA and GLA FAs in H&N cancer patients. It failed however to protect against weight loss, or improve nutritional parameters.","lang":"eng"}],"intvolume":"        14","page_count":"14","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-5822492","keyword":["Head and neck cancer","Weight loss","Echium oil","Cachexia","Radio(chemo)therapy","Curative intent","QUALITY-OF-LIFE","N-3 FATTY-ACIDS","GAMMA-LINOLENIC ACID","CELL EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID","STEARIDONIC ACID","ERYTHROCYTE-MEMBRANE","ESOPHAGEAL CANCER","CLINICAL-TRIAL","EUROPEAN-ORGANIZATION","AMBULATORY PATIENTS"],"external_id":{"isi":"000345800400004"},"_version":5,"department":[{"_id":"GE17","tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]},{"_id":"GE01","tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","type":"journal_article","title":"Echium oil is not protective against weight loss in head and neck cancer patients undergoing curative radio(chemo)therapy: a randomised-controlled trial","subject":["Medicine and Health Sciences"],"publication":"BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE","creator":{"id":"F82045C6-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"status":"public","publication_status":"published","publication_abbreviation":"BMC Complement.

Over the past decade, the armamentarium for systemic therapy of metastatic RCC (mRCC) has undergone important changes with implementation of targeted therapies directed against pathways involved in the pathogenesis of RCC. We describe first-line treatment choice of a group of patients in 9 Belgian oncology centres between October 2009 and November 2012. \r\nMethods: A clinical report form was established to assess patient characteristics, Karnofsky performance score, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk criteria (MSKCC) and first-line therapy of mRCC patients. Choice of therapy and starting dose was analyzed before and after reimbursement of pazopanib in Belgium. \r\nResults: Ninety-six patients were eligible for the study. Non-smokers accounted for 53% of the patients. Seventy-three per cent of the patients had 0 or 1 MSKCC criteria in the group of patients that started treatment more than 1 year after initial diagnosis. In the group of patients that started therapy less than 1 year after diagnosis, 85% had 2 or more MSKCC criteria. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.0001). Overall distribution of the first-line therapies consisted of 43% sunitinib, 33% pazopanib, 14% temsirolimus, 7% everolimus and 3% sorafenib. Seventeen (18%) out of 96 patients started at a reduced dose level. \r\nConclusion: This report shows that the guidelines for the start of first-line treatment in mRCC in 9 centres in Belgium were applied most of the time: a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was the first treatment choice for most patients while temsirolimus was an option for poor prognosis patients. In the majority of patients standard dose levels were initiated, although in some patients adaptation of dosage/treatment schedule was recorded."}],"intvolume":"        69","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-5822505","page_first":"335","external_id":{"isi":"000345841600004"},"citation":{"fwo":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cornelis, Natasha, Tijl Vermassen, D Schallier, J-P Machiels, T Gil, PR Debruyne, R D’hondt, A Bols, D Schrijvers, J Mebis, Nicolaas Lumen, and Sylvie Rottey. 2014. “Prospective Non-interventional Multicentre Observational Trial of First-line Anti-cancer Treatment in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer in Belgium.” <i>Acta Clinica Belgica</i> 69 (5): 335–340.</div>\n","chicago-author-date":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cornelis, Natasha, Tijl Vermassen, D Schallier, J-P Machiels, T Gil, PR Debruyne, R D’hondt, et al. 2014. “Prospective Non-interventional Multicentre Observational Trial of First-line Anti-cancer Treatment in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer in Belgium.” <i>Acta Clinica Belgica</i> 69 (5): 335–340.</div>\n","mla":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">Cornelis, Natasha, Tijl Vermassen, D Schallier, et al. “Prospective Non-interventional Multicentre Observational Trial of First-line Anti-cancer Treatment in Patients with Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer in Belgium.” <i>ACTA CLINICA BELGICA</i> 69.5 (2014): 335–340.

Digital ECG recordings were obtained during Cycle 1 over 24 h after dosing. The primary end point was effect of cabazitaxel on QT interval corrected by the Fridericia formula (QTcF). Secondary end points were additional ECG parameters (QT, PR and QRS intervals, and heart rate), plasma pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel and overall clinical safety.\r\nResults: The pharmacodynamic (ECG) population included 94 patients. In 63 patients with a full 24-h ECG evaluation, the maximum upper bound of 90 % confidence interval (CI) for mean QTcF change from baseline was 7.46 ms (mean 4.8 ms), occurring at 1 h 30 min post-infusion. The slope of QTcF change from baseline versus cabazitaxel concentration was slightly negative (-0.012 [95 % CI -0.017; -0.008], equivalent to a 1.2 ms decrease per 100 ng/mL increase in cabazitaxel concentration). For non-QT variables, no effect was noted. No Grade a parts per thousand yen3 cardiac adverse events were observed; Grade a parts per thousand yen3 hypotension and lymphocele occurred in two patients and one patient, respectively.\r\nConclusion: These results suggest that cabazitaxel has no clinically significant cardiovascular adverse effects in patients with advanced solid tumors.","lang":"eng"}],"user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","intvolume":"        73","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-5822524","_version":2,"page_first":"1241","keyword":["Advanced solid tumors","Cardiac safety","QTc interval","Cabazitaxel","Pharmacokinetics","ECG","EVERY 3 WEEKS","QT INTERVAL","CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT","RESEARCH CONSORTIUM","PROARRHYTHMIC RISK","PHASE-I","MANAGEMENT","ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY","PROLONGATION","TAXANE"],"external_id":{"isi":"000336395700016"},"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Maison-Blanche P, Dakhil S, Baron A, Rottey S, Millard F, Daugaard G, et al.

In zebrafish expression studies, many commonly used reference genes are not generally applicable given their variability in expression levels under a variety of experimental conditions. Inappropriate use of these reference genes may lead to false interpretation of expression data and unreliable conclusions. In this study, we evaluated a novel normalization method in zebrafish using expressed repetitive elements (ERE) as reference targets, instead of specific protein coding mRNA targets. We assessed and compared the expression stability of a number of EREs to that of commonly used zebrafish reference genes in a diverse set of experimental conditions including a developmental time series, a set of different organs from adult fish and different treatments of zebrafish embryos including morpholino injections and administration of chemicals. Using geNorm and rank aggregation analysis we demonstrated that EREs have a higher overall expression stability compared to the commonly used reference genes. Moreover, we propose a limited set of ERE reference targets (hatn10, dna15ta1 and loopern4), that show stable expression throughout the wide range of experiments in this study, as strong candidates for inclusion as reference targets for qPCR normalization in future zebrafish expression studies. Our applied strategy to find and evaluate candidate expressed repeat elements for RT-qPCR data normalization has high potential to be used also for other species.","lang":"eng"}],"page_count":"10","intvolume":"         9","article_type":"original","author":[{"full_name":"Vanhauwaert, Suzanne","last_name":"Vanhauwaert","id":"34E49DB8-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Suzanne","orcid":"0000-0002-7768-4549"},{"first_name":"Gert","last_name":"Van Peer","id":"040D108A-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Van Peer, Gert"},{"first_name":"Ali","last_name":"Rihani","id":"FAB0B384-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Rihani, Ali"},{"full_name":"Janssens, Els","id":"98AE6FF0-D30E-11E3-AB4F-F2E74B2F559A","last_name":"Janssens","first_name":"Els"},{"full_name":"Rondou, Pieter","last_name":"Rondou","id":"F723BFF4-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Pieter","orcid":"0000-0002-2953-1732"},{"orcid":"0000-0002-6936-8239","id":"F831B6BC-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Lefever","first_name":"Steve","full_name":"Lefever, Steve"},{"full_name":"De Paepe, Anne","last_name":"De Paepe","id":"F403A000-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Anne","orcid":"0000-0002-4134-5940"},{"orcid":"0000-0001-7119-586X","last_name":"Coucke","id":"F6730D80-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Paul","full_name":"Coucke, Paul"},{"full_name":"Speleman, Franki","first_name":"Franki","last_name":"Speleman","id":"F4388FA4-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},{"first_name":"Jo","id":"F5540E9A-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Vandesompele","orcid":"0000-0001-6274-0184","full_name":"Vandesompele, Jo"},{"last_name":"Willaert","id":"F6AE9EC2-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Andy","orcid":"0000-0002-9543-1932","full_name":"Willaert, Andy"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0109091","accept":"1","locked":"1","urn":"urn:whatever-58225674","volume":9,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["1932-6203"]},"date_created":"2015-01-27T11:47:32Z","year":"2014","has_main_file":1,"file":[{"relation":"main_file","date_updated":"2017-03-03T14:11:35Z","content_type":"application/pdf","date_created":"2015-01-27T11:47:32Z","file_name":"journal.pone.0109091.pdf","file_id":"5822590","file_size":"742022","creator":null,"access_level":"open_access","open_access":1}],"article_number":"e109091","_id":"5822567"}

The purpose of this project was to operationalize electronic INN prescribing for outpatient care in daily medical practice and to develop a factual database which can be used in electronic INN prescribing applications.\n   Methods: The operationalization process consisted of three phases: (1) expert consultation, (2) review by regulatory authorities and (3) test phase with stakeholders and end-users.\n   Results: The INN prescribing project resulted into (1) operational rules for electronic INN prescribing and (2) a reference database to be implemented in commercial medical software. The operational rules for electronic INN prescribing define valid INN groups as sets of equivalent medicinal products, described by three elements: the therapeutic moiety (the active part of the therapeutic ingredient) or combination of therapeutic moieties, the strength (with standardized denominators), and the method of administration (with simplified but standardized options). The operational rules also define two categories of exemptions for INN prescribing: INN groups where the first choice of treatment should be continued throughout the therapy period (NO SWITCH) and medicinal product groups not suitable for INN prescribing (NO INN). The reference database is the result of the virtual classification of the Belgian therapeutic arsenal into INN groups, according to the operational rules.\n   Conclusions: Defining the operational rules for INN prescribing for and with different stakeholders was a difficult yet feasible assignment. The INN prescribing project resulted into explicit operational rules and a reference database. The Belgian experience may provide important information for other countries planning to operationalize or refine electronic INN prescribing. It can also be used for a thorough evaluation of the impact of the new concept of INN prescribing on daily practice and on medical education. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Experimental absorption coefficients of QD functionalized strip waveguides range from 10-30 cm-1. These values are about five times larger than the absorption coefficient of QD functionalized planarized waveguides. Using a refractive index as determined from effective medium theory including dipolar coupling between the QDs, we obtain simulated values for the absorption coefficient that are in quantitative agreement with the experimental values and we find that difference with planarized waveguides results from an increased overlap between the QD layer and the guided optical mode in the case of strip waveguides. The modeling of the absorption coefficients of more complex strip waveguides functionalized by colloidal QDs as demonstrated in this study will enable the development and simulation of QD-based photonic devices integrated in silicon."}],"cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","user_id":"2656FCBE-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","author":[{"last_name":"Omari","id":"1660AC88-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Abdoulghafar","full_name":"Omari, Abdoulghafar"},{"last_name":"Xie","id":"38230BF4-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Weiqiang","full_name":"Xie, Weiqiang"},{"first_name":"Pieter","id":"0447BF32-F0EE-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Geiregat","orcid":"0000-0001-7217-8738","full_name":"Geiregat, Pieter"},{"full_name":"Van Thourhout, Dries","orcid":"0000-0003-0111-431X","first_name":"Dries","last_name":"Van Thourhout","id":"F4F6F962-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},{"first_name":"Zeger","last_name":"Hens","id":"F4EE4434-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","full_name":"Hens, Zeger"}],"extern":0,"article_type":"original","locked":1,"accept":1,"doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2014.2304180","has_main_file":1,"year":"2014","date_created":"2015-01-27T12:20:28Z","publication_identifier":{"issn":["1077-260X"]},"volume":20,"_id":"5822884","file":[{"file_name":"06730678.pdf","date_created":"2015-01-27T12:20:28Z","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2015-11-23T14:08:34Z","relation":"main_file","access_level":"local","file_size":"1039137","file_id":"5823046"}],"article_number":"4400306","date_updated":"2016-12-21T15:42:01Z","project":[{"name":"Center for nano- and biophotonics (NB-Photonics)","_id":"01MR0110"}],"publication_abbreviation":"IEEE J.

{"abstract":[{"lang":"eng","text":"Activating mutations of the ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma Kinase) gene have been identified in sporadic and familial cases of neuroblastoma, a cancer of early childhood arising from the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). To decipher ALK function in neuroblastoma predisposition and oncogenesis, we have characterized knock-in (KI) mice bearing the two most frequent mutations observed in neuroblastoma patients. A dramatic enlargement of sympathetic ganglia is observed in Alk(F1178L) mice from embryonic to adult stages associated with an increased proliferation of sympathetic neuroblasts from E14.5 to birth. In a MYCN transgenic context, the F1178L mutation displays a higher oncogenic potential than the R1279Q mutation as evident from a shorter latency of tumor onset. We show that tumors expressing the R1279Q mutation are sensitive to ALK inhibition upon crizotinib treatment. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that activated ALK triggers RET upregulation in mouse sympathetic ganglia at birth as well as in murine and human neuroblastoma. Using vandetanib, we show that RET inhibition strongly impairs tumor growth in vivo in both MYCN/KI Alk(R1279Q) and MYCN/KI Alk(F1178L) mice. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the critical role of activated ALK in SNS development and pathogenesis and identify RET as a therapeutic target in ALK mutated neuroblastoma."}],"cc_license":"I have retained and own the full copyright for this publication","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","intvolume":"         5","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-5822973","_version":7,"page_first":"2688","keyword":["CLASSIFICATION","PREDISPOSITION","TUMORS","PATHOGENESIS","SYSTEM","ANAPLASTIC LYMPHOMA KINASE","MYCN","MUTATIONS","CANCER","RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASE","RET","therapeutic target","neurogenesis","ALK","Neuroblastoma"],"external_id":{"isi":"000336966600029"},"article_type":"original","author":[{"full_name":"Cazes, Alex","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Cazes"},{"last_name":"Lopez-Delisle","first_name":"Lucille","full_name":"Lopez-Delisle, Lucille"},{"full_name":"Tsarovina, Konstantina","last_name":"Tsarovina","first_name":"Konstantina"},{"first_name":"Cécile","last_name":"Pierre-Eugène","full_name":"Pierre-Eugène, Cécile"},{"full_name":"De Preter, Katleen","first_name":"Katleen","last_name":"De Preter","id":"F60746CC-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","orcid":"0000-0002-7726-5096"},{"full_name":"Peuchmaur, Michel","first_name":"Michel","last_name":"Peuchmaur"},{"first_name":"André","last_name":"Nicolas","full_name":"Nicolas, André"},{"full_name":"Provost, Claire","last_name":"Provost","first_name":"Claire"},{"full_name":"Louis-Brennetot, Caroline","first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"Louis-Brennetot"},{"first_name":"Romain","last_name":"Daveau","full_name":"Daveau, Romain"},{"full_name":"Kumps, Candy","id":"F99CB9FC-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Kumps","first_name":"Candy"},{"first_name":"Ilaria","last_name":"Cascone","full_name":"Cascone, Ilaria"},{"full_name":"Schleiermacher, Gudrun","first_name":"Gudrun","last_name":"Schleiermacher"},{"last_name":"Prignon","first_name":"Aurélie","full_name":"Prignon, Aurélie"},{"first_name":"Franki","id":"F4388FA4-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Speleman","full_name":"Speleman, Franki"},{"first_name":"Hermann","last_name":"Rohrer","full_name":"Rohrer, Hermann"},{"full_name":"Delattre, Olivier","last_name":"Delattre","first_name":"Olivier"},{"full_name":"Janoueix-Lerosey, Isabelle","first_name":"Isabelle","last_name":"Janoueix-Lerosey"}],"publication_identifier":{"issn":["1949-2553"]},"volume":5,"date_created":"2015-01-27T12:23:17Z","has_main_file":1,"year":"2014","accept":"1","doi":"10.18632/oncotarget.1883","locked":"1","_id":"5822973","file":[{"date_created":"2015-01-27T12:23:17Z","file_name":"cazes2014.pdf","content_type":"application/pdf","date_updated":"2017-02-22T14:04:08Z","relation":"main_file","open_access":0,"creator":null,"access_level":"local","file_size":"6179272","file_id":"5823013"}],"publication_status":"published","status":"public","publication_abbreviation":"Oncotarget","date_updated":"2017-02-22T14:04:08Z","publication":"ONCOTARGET","reviewer_tags":["PDF toegang: OA CClic"],"has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"F46CE8EE-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"wos_type":"Article","title":"Activated Alk triggers prolonged neurogenesis and Ret upregulation providing a therapeutic target in ALK-mutated neuroblastoma","type":"journal_article","classification":"A1","subject":["Biology and Life Sciences"],"has_message":"0","page_last":"2702","department":[{"_id":"GE02","tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"issue":"9"}

Applied successfully in coastal marine sediments, its extension to lake-sediment records with potentially high time resolution would greatly expand its utility. Over the last years, however, studies have indicated the presence of additional sources of brGDGTs within lake systems. To constrain the factors influencing the MBT/CBT palaeotemperature proxy in lakes, detailed investigation of brGDGT fluxes in a modern lake system is necessary to identify their potential sources. This study concentrates on Lake Challa, a permanently stratified crater lake in equatorial East Africa with limited catchment area. An almost 3-year time series of approximately monthly samples of settling particles, supplemented with a depth profile of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sets of profundal surface-sediment and catchment soil samples, were analysed for both the 'living' intact polar lipids (IPLs) and 'fossil' core lipids (CLs) of GDGTs. We found that brGDGTs are produced in oxic, suboxic and anoxic zones of the water column, and in substantial amounts compared to influxes from catchment soils. Additional in situ production within the lake sediments is most probable, but cannot be definitely confirmed at this time. These lacustrine brGDGTs display a different response to temperature variation than soil-derived brGDGTs, signifying either a different physiological adaptation to changing conditions within the water column and/or a different composition of the respective bacterial communities. Using this specific relationship with temperature, a local calibration based on brGDGT distributions in SPM generates relatively accurate water temperature estimates from settling particles but fails for surface sediments.

This may impair patients' quality of life, cause pain and discomfort. In this study, we investigated treatment and patient-related factors, including genetic polymorphisms, that can modify the risk for severe radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. \r\nMethods: We studied 377 patients treated at Ghent University Hospital and at ST.-Elisabeth Clinic and Maternity in Namur, with adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer. Women were treated in a prone or supine position with normofractionated (25 x 2 Gy) or hypofractionated (15 x 2.67 Gy) IMRT alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. Patient-and treatment-related factors and genetic markers in regulatory regions of radioresponsive genes and in LIG3, MLH1 and XRCC3 genes were considered as variables. Acute dermatitis was scored using the CTCAEv3.0 scoring system. Desquamation was scored separately on a 3-point scale (0-none, 1-dry, 2-moist). \r\nResults: Two-hundred and twenty patients (58%) developed G2+ dermatitis whereas moist desquamation occurred in 56 patients (15%). Normofractionation (both p < 0.001), high body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001), bra cup size >= D (p = 0.001 and p = 0.043) and concurrent hormone therapy (p = 0.001 and p = 0.037) were significantly associated with occurrence of acute dermatitis and moist desquamation, respectively. Additional factors associated with an increased risk of acute dermatitis were the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734 (p=0.008), smoking during RT (p = 0.010) and supine IMRT (p = 0.004). Patients receiving trastuzumab showed decreased risk of acute dermatitis (p < 0.001). \r\nConclusions: The normofractionation schedule, supine IMRT, concomitant hormone treatment and patient related factors (high BMI, large breast, smoking during treatment and the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734) were associated with increased acute skin toxicity in patients receiving radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Trastuzumab seemed to be protective."}],"page_count":"9","intvolume":"        14","handle":"http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-5848950","external_id":{"isi":"000342587400001"},"keyword":["ADVERSE-REACTIONS","RANDOMIZED-TRIAL","RADIATION-THERAPY","Radiotherapy","Genetic polymorphisms","Breast cancer","Acute skin toxicity","Large breast size","DERMATITIS","IRRADIATION","CANCER-PATIENTS","ASSOCIATION","POLYMORPHISMS","INJURY","IMRT"],"_version":8,"article_number":"711","file":[{"file_size":"226727","access_level":"open_access","creator":null,"file_id":"5849079","open_access":1,"date_updated":"2017-03-07T09:07:11Z","relation":"main_file","file_name":"Breast_cancer_RS_acute_2014.pdf","date_created":"2015-02-16T11:38:18Z","content_type":"application/pdf"}],"_id":"5848950","volume":14,"publication_identifier":{"issn":["1471-2407"]},"has_main_file":1,"date_created":"2015-02-16T11:38:18Z","year":"2014","doi":"10.1186/1471-2407-14-711","accept":"1","urn":"urn:whatever-58489505","locked":"1","publication":"BMC CANCER","reviewer_tags":["PDF toegang: OA CClic"],"has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"F61DB8BC-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"status":"public","publication_status":"published","project":[{"_id":"Cancer Plan, Action 29 project 015","name":"Cancer Plan, Action 29 project 015"}],"publication_abbreviation":"BMC Cancer","date_updated":"2017-03-07T09:07:12Z","department":[{"tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}],"_id":"GE17"},{"_id":"GE05","tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"has_message":"0","language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"classification":"A1","wos_type":"Article","type":"journal_article","title":"Factors modifying the risk for developing acute skin toxicity after whole-breast intensity modulated radiotherapy","subject":["Medicine and Health Sciences"]}

Isomorphous substitution was demonstrated as a viable option for stabilization of the fully connected OKO framework as this renders the closed framework flexible.\nC1 [Verheyen, E.; Yuan, R.; Breynaert, E.; Taulelle, F.; Martensa, J.

The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may help explain the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma and assist in identifying patients at higher risk for poor survival. SNPs in the TP53 pathway are of special importance, as several studies have reported associations between TP53 pathway SNPs and cancer. Of note, less than 2% of neuroblastoma tumors have a TP53 mutation at diagnosis. \r\nPatients and Methods: We selected 21 of the most frequently studied SNPs in the TP53 pathway and evaluated their association with outcome in 500 neuroblastoma patients using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. \r\nResults and Conclusion: We investigated the impact of 21 SNPs on overall survival, event-free survival, age at diagnosis, MYCN status, and stage of the disease in 500 neuroblastoma patients. A missense SNP in exon 10 of the CASP8 gene SNP D302H was associated with worse overall and event-free survival in patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors."}],"cc_license":"I have retained and own the full copyright for this publication","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","page_count":"13","intvolume":"         9","article_type":"original","author":[{"full_name":"Rihani, Ali","last_name":"Rihani","id":"FAB0B384-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Ali"},{"full_name":"De Wilde, Bram","last_name":"De Wilde","id":"FB7AAD38-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Bram","orcid":"0000-0003-0213-1322"},{"last_name":"Zeka","first_name":"Fjorabla","full_name":"Zeka, Fjorabla"},{"first_name":"Genevieve","id":"F42BF08C-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Laureys","full_name":"Laureys, Genevieve"},{"full_name":"Francotte, Nadine","first_name":"Nadine","last_name":"Francotte"},{"last_name":"Tonini","first_name":"Gian Paolo","full_name":"Tonini, Gian Paolo"},{"full_name":"Coco, Simona","first_name":"Simona","last_name":"Coco"},{"last_name":"Versteeg","first_name":"Rogier","full_name":"Versteeg, Rogier"},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"Noguera","full_name":"Noguera, Rosa"},{"first_name":"Johannes H","last_name":"Schulte","full_name":"Schulte, Johannes H"},{"full_name":"Eggert, Angelika","first_name":"Angelika","last_name":"Eggert"},{"full_name":"Stallings, Raymond L","last_name":"Stallings","first_name":"Raymond L"},{"last_name":"Speleman","id":"F4388FA4-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","first_name":"Franki","full_name":"Speleman, Franki"},{"full_name":"Vandesompele, Jo","id":"F5540E9A-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Vandesompele","first_name":"Jo","orcid":"0000-0001-6274-0184"},{"full_name":"Van Maerken, Tom","first_name":"Tom","id":"F7234196-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","last_name":"Van Maerken","orcid":"0000-0003-1989-1336"}],"title":"CASP8 SNP D302H (rs1045485) is associated with worse survival in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma patients","type":"journal_article","wos_type":"Article","classification":"A1","subject":["Biology and Life Sciences"],"language":[{"iso":"eng"}],"issue":"12","has_message":"0","department":[{"_id":"GE02","tree":[{"_id":"GE"},{"_id":"UGent"}]}],"publication_abbreviation":"PLoS One","date_updated":"2017-04-18T13:00:55Z","publication_status":"published","status":"public","has_file":1,"creator":{"id":"F42BF08C-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4"},"publication":"PLOS ONE","reviewer_tags":["PDF toegang: OA CClic"]}

However, the zoonotic potential of this pathogen, phylogenetically closely related to Chlamydia trachomatis, is still uninvestigated. Therefore, this study aims to examine the zoonotic transmission in a Belgian pig abattoir.\n   Methods: Presence of Chlamydia suis in pigs, contact surfaces, air and employees was assessed using a Chlamydia suis specific real-time PCR and culture. Furthermore, Chlamydia suis isolates were tested for the presence of the tet(C) gene.\n   Results: Chlamydia suis bacteria could be demonstrated in samples from pigs, the air and contact surfaces. Moreover, eye swabs of two employees were positive for Chlamydia suis by both PCR and culture. The tet(C) gene was absent in both human Chlamydia suis isolates and no clinical signs were reported.\n   Conclusions: These findings suggest the need for further epidemiological and clinical research to elucidate the significance of human ocular Chlamydia suis infections.\nC1 [De Puysseleyr, Kristien; De Puysseleyr, Leentje; Vanrompay, Daisy] Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Mol Biotechnol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.\n   [Dhondt, Hendrik; Geens, Tom] Provikmo, Occupat Hlth Serv, Brugge, Belgium.\n   [Braeckman, Lutgart] Univ Ghent, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.\n   [Morre, Servaas A.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Med Ctr, Immunogenet Lab, Dept Med Microbiol & Infect Control, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n   [Morre, Servaas A.] Univ Maastricht, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Sch Oncol & Dev Biol, Dept Genet & Cell Biol,IPHG,Res Sch GROW, Maastricht, Netherlands.\n   [Cox, Eric] Univ Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Dept Virol Parasitol & Immunol, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.\nRP De Puysseleyr, K (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Fac Biosci Engn, Dept Mol Biotechnol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.\nEM Kristien.DePuysseleyr@ugent.be\nFU Federal Public Service of Health, Safety of the Food Chain and\n   Environment [RF-10/6234]; Ghent University [IOF/STARTT/002]; MSD Animal\n   Health (Boxmeer, The Netherlands)\nFX This study was funded by the Federal Public Service of Health, Safety of\n   the Food Chain and Environment (convention RF-10/6234), Ghent University\n   (IOF/STARTT/002) and MSD Animal Health (Boxmeer, The Netherlands).\nNR 28\nPU BIOMED CENTRAL LTD\nPI LONDON\nPA 236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND\nSN 1471-2334\nJ9 BMC INFECT DIS\nJI BMC Infect.

Based on previous work, we recall properties of the complete lifts of a type (1, 1) tensor R on E to both T*E and J(1)tau*. We discuss how an interplay between both lifted tensors leads to the identification of related distributions on both manifolds. The integrability of these distributions, a coordinate free condition, is shown to produce exactly Forbat's conditions for separability of the time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation in appropriate coordinates.

Other diseases transmitted by these vectors could emerge. This justifies the development of syndromic surveillance programs whereby one or several indicators would be routinely monitored for the early detection of emerging diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate milk yield from milk recording in dairy cattle as an indicator to be included in an emerging disease surveillance system. It was hypothesized that emergences would result in episodes of low milk production clustered in space and time. The 2007 BTV epizootic in France was used as a case study. Because it had already emerged in neighbouring countries, the disease emergence was expected and notification was mandatory. Herd-test-day milk productions were predicted for the entire country for 2006 and 2007 from herd historical data using linear mixed models. The differences between observed and predicted milk productions were averaged per week and per municipality and used as input for a space-time prospective scan statistic. Log likelihood ratios (LLR) associated with clusters were used to define alarms. The threshold chosen was a trade-off between detection timeliness and the number of false alarms per week. The first four BTV notifications occurred on the 12th (two notifications), 13th and 27th of July 2007. The 12th of July was considered to be the date of emergence. Alarms occurring before the 1st of March 2007 were considered to be false alarms. Using an LLR of 50, there were an average of 1.7 false alarms per week and the BTV emergence was detected seven weeks after emergence. Using an LLR of 100, there were an average of 0.8 false alarms per week and the BTV emergence was detected 9 weeks after emergence. Detection may have been delayed because of a discontinuation of milk recording between mid-July and mid-August. The first cluster with an LLR > 100 located in the emergence area was further investigated. A difference between observed and predicted production of >1 kg/cow/day was observed around the time of emergence. However, a difference of equal magnitude was observed during the year preceding the outbreak. Milk production predicted from herd history alone did not allow the detection of the 2007 BTV emergence in France. Further research should be conducted on improving the prediction of test-day milk yield and on combining it with other indicators based on routinely collected data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Dose-volume parameters were analyzed for heart, left anterior descending coronary artery, ipsilateral lung and both breasts.\n   Results. - Pr-IN consistently reduced (P < 0.001) heart and left anterior descending coronary artery dose metrics compared to Pr-EX Population averages for maximum and mean heart dose were 6.2 Gy and 13 Gy for Pr-IN versus 21.4 Gy and 2.5 Gy for Pr-IN respectively. Moreover, a maximum heart dose less than 10 Gy was achieved in 80% of patients for Pr-IN.

However, there is a paucity of epidemiologic evidence on adult-onset asthma in community-based populations. \r\nObjective: We sought to evaluate the epidemiology and the clinical significance of staphylococcal enterotoxin sensitization in community-based adult populations. \r\nMethods: The present analyses were performed using the baseline data set of Korean adult population surveys, consisting of 1080 adults (mean age=60.2years) recruited from an urban and a rural community. Questionnaires, methacholine challenge tests, and allergen skin tests were performed for defining clinical phenotypes. Sera were analysed for total IgE and enterotoxin-specific IgE using ImmunoCAP. \r\nResults: Staphylococcal enterotoxin sensitization (0.35kU/L) had a prevalence of 27.0%. Risk factors were identified as male sex, current smoking, advanced age (61years), and inhalant allergen sensitization. Current asthma was mostly adult onset (18years old) and showed independent associations with high enterotoxin-specific IgE levels in multivariate logistic regression tests. In multivariate linear regressions, staphylococcal enterotoxin-specific IgE level was identified as the major determinant factor for total IgE level. \r\nConclusions and Clinical Relevance: Staphylococcal enterotoxin sensitization was independently associated with adult-onset asthma in adult community populations. Strong correlations between the enterotoxin-specific IgE and total IgE levels support the clinical significance. The present findings warrant further studies for the precise roles of staphylococcal enterotoxin sensitization in the asthma pathogenesis."}],"cc_license":"I have transferred the copyright for this publication to the publisher","user_id":"F40B1E02-F0ED-11E1-A9DE-61C894A0A6B4","_version":5,"citation":{"vancouver":"  <div class=\"csl-entry\">\n    <div class=\"csl-left-margin\">1. </div><div class=\"csl-right-inline\">Song W-J, Chang Y-S, Lim MK, Yun EH, Kim S-H, Kang H-R, et al.

Previous studies showed provision of information to and free modality choice by patients to be suboptimal. Therefore, the European Kidney Patients' Federation (CEAPIR) explored European patients' perceptions regarding information, education and involvement on the modality selection process.\n   Methods: CEAPIR developed a survey, which was disseminated by the national kidney patient organisations in Europe.\n   Results: In total, 3867 patients from 36 countries completed the survey. Respondents were either on in-centre haemodialysis (53%) or had a functioning graft (38%) at the time of survey. The majority (78%) evaluated the general information about kidney disease and treatment as helpful, but 39% did not recall being told about alternative treatment options than their current one. Respondents were more often satisfied with information provided on in-centre haemodialysis (90%) and transplantation (87%) than with information provided on peritoneal dialysis (79%) or home haemodialysis (61%), and were more satisfied with information from health care professionals vs other sources such as social media.

Basic phase shifters require 700 mW of power for a 2 pi phase shift. The required power is brought down to 80 mW by complete undercut using focused ion beam. Finally an efficient thermo-optic phase shifter is demonstrated on the germanium on SOI platform. A tuning power (for a 2 pi phase shift) of 105 mW is achieved for a Ge-on-SOI structure which is lowered to 16 mW for a free standing phase shifter.
